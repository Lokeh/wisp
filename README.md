## Reset a ghost blog password

Since I'm not too bright, I always forget what I set my password to while working on my blog locally. So I wrote a tool to reset my password for me.

I only tested this with node v0.10.35. Normally I'm all about io.js but Ghost requires v0.10, so I'm usually using v0.10 when working on a project in Ghost.
